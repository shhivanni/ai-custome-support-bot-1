1. **System Prompts**: Define the bot's role and behavior
2. **Context Injection**: Include FAQ knowledge and conversation history
3. **Response Formatting**: Structure outputs for easy parsing
4. **Escalation Detection**: Identify when human intervention is needed
5. **Conversation Summarization**: Generate meaningful summaries

## 🤖 Main System Prompt

## 📊 Conversation Summarization

### Summarization Prompt

```
Summarize this customer support conversation. Include:
1. Main customer issue or question
2. Key points discussed
3. Resolution status
4. Any unresolved concerns

Keep the summary concise but comprehensive.
```

### Example Conversation Summary

**Input Conversation**:
- User: "I can't log into my account"
- Bot: "I can help with login issues. What happens when you try to log in?"
- User: "It says my password is wrong but I'm sure it's correct"
- Bot: "Let's try resetting your password..."
- User: "Ok I'll try that, thanks"

**Generated Summary**:
```
Customer conversation with 3 exchanges. Main issue: Login problems due to password authentication failure. Key points: Customer unable to access account with current password. Bot provided password reset instructions as solution. Resolution status: Issue addressed with password reset process. No unresolved concerns - customer accepted the solution.
```

## 🎯 Prompt Engineering Strategies

### 1. Context Management

**Challenge**: Maintaining conversation context without exceeding token limits.
**Solution**: 
- Include last 10 conversation exchanges
- Prioritize recent messages
- Summarize older context when needed

```python
# Context building example
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}]

# Add conversation history (last 10 exchanges)
for conv in conversation_history[-10:]:
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": conv["user_message"]})
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": conv["bot_response"]})

# Add current user message
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
```

### 2. FAQ Integration

**Challenge**: Making FAQ knowledge searchable and relevant.
**Approach**:
- Dynamic FAQ injection based on relevance
- Keyword-based FAQ filtering
- Priority-based FAQ ordering

### 3. Escalation Detection

**Multi-layered Approach**:
1. **LLM Tags**: `[ESCALATE]` markers in responses
2. **Keyword Detection**: Scanning for escalation terms
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting negative emotions
4. **Context Patterns**: Multiple failed attempts

```python
def _should_escalate(self, user_message, bot_response):
    # Check bot response for escalation markers
    if "[ESCALATE]" in bot_response.upper():
        return True
    
    # Check user message for escalation keywords
    escalation_keywords = ["angry", "frustrated", "manager", "human", "refund"]
    user_lower = user_message.lower()
    
    return any(keyword in user_lower for keyword in escalation_keywords)
```

### 4. Response Quality Control

**Techniques**:
- **Temperature Control**: 0.7 for balanced creativity/consistency
- **Token Limits**: Max 1000 tokens to maintain focus
- **Response Validation**: Check for required format elements
- **Fallback Responses**: Handle API failures gracefully

## 🔧 Customization Guidelines

### Modifying System Prompts

1. **Preserve Core Structure**: Keep role definition and guidelines
2. **Industry Adaptation**: Customize for specific domains
3. **Brand Voice**: Adjust tone and language style
4. **Escalation Rules**: Modify based on support model

### Example Industry Customizations

#### Healthcare Support Bot
```
You are a healthcare customer support assistant. Your goal is to help patients with non-medical inquiries about our services, appointments, and billing.

IMPORTANT: You cannot provide medical advice. Always direct medical questions to healthcare professionals.

Guidelines:
1. Be compassionate and understanding
2. Maintain patient confidentiality
3. For medical questions, immediately escalate to medical staff
4. Handle appointment scheduling with care for urgency
...
```

```
You are an e-commerce customer support assistant specializing in order management, shipping, and product information.

Guidelines:
1. Prioritize order and shipping inquiries
2. Provide accurate product information
3. Handle returns and exchanges efficiently
4. Escalate payment disputes immediately
...
```

### FAQ Customization

**Structure Requirements**:
```json
{
    "question": "Clear, customer-focused question",
    "answer": "Step-by-step, actionable answer",
    "category": "Logical grouping",
    "keywords": "search-relevant terms",
    "priority": 1
}
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use natural language questions
- Provide specific, actionable answers
- Include relevant keywords for matching
- Set appropriate priorities (1=high, 5=low)

### A/B Testing Prompts

**Test Different Elements**:
- Greeting styles
- FAQ presentation formats
- Escalation sensitivity
- Response tone and length

**Measurement Approach**:
- Track conversation outcomes
- Monitor escalation patterns
- Collect user feedback

## 🔍 Debugging Prompts

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Over-Escalation
**Problem**: Bot escalates too frequently
**Solution**: Tighten escalation criteria, increase confidence threshold

#### 2. Under-Escalation  
**Problem**: Bot doesn't escalate when needed
**Solution**: Expand keyword list, lower confidence threshold

#### 3. Poor FAQ Matching
**Problem**: Relevant FAQs not being used
**Solution**: Improve keyword coverage, adjust matching algorithm

#### 4. Inconsistent Responses
**Problem**: Bot gives different answers to similar questions
**Solution**: Reduce temperature, improve system prompt clarity

### Testing Prompts

**Test Suite for Prompts**:
